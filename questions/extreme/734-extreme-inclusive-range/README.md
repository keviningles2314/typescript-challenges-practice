Recursion depth in type system is one of the limitations of TypeScript, the number is around 45.

_We need to go deeper_. And we could go deeper.

In this challenge, you are given one lower boundary and one higher boundary, by which a range of natural numbers is inclusively sliced. You should develop a technique that enables you to do recursion deeper than the limitation, since both boundary vary from 0 to 200.

Note that when `Lower > Higher`, output an empty tuple.
